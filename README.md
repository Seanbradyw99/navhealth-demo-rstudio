# About NavHealth

> We're empowering health systems and patients to make better use of personal health data. 

> NavHealth supports health systems contracting for population health to better engage patients in the safe, secure collection and use of health data to inform better health decisions. We enable patients to share health data that is accessible to them, by HIPAA right from a growing number of providers, with trusted health systems to paint a more complete picture of the patient's journey, and to engage them in making better health decisions. 

> Using permissioned data, NavHealth helps health systems find meaning in that information to uncover gaps in care or identify recommended preventive services that ultimately strengthen network utilization and improve health outcomes.

> We are led by Aneesh Chopra (former U.S. CTO) with board members including Sanju Bansal (co-founder of MicroStrategy) & Dan Ross (former CEO of Claraview).
